# AdverserialAgentAI
Alpha-beta pruning implementation

In this project, I implemented an adversarial search algorithm to find valid and good moves for a minichess game.

## To try
The AB.py program takes in a valid chess move by an opponent and outputs a best move generated by the alpha-beta algorithm.
The program assumes it is playing against another agent
